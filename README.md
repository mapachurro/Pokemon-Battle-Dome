# Pokemon Battle Dome
I built this game for an assignment at the CWRU Bootcamp, which was intended to teach us to use jquery and javascript.
For purposes of getting the design out of the way quickly, I built the page in bootstrap, which later had functionality consequences 
with jquery and what I wanted to happen with the UX.

In any case, the original version of the game was cool, but very buggy, and didn't do what it was supposed to. You know, like 
count HP properly and reset/play again. You know.

So I took some time later to rebuild it properly with a constructor and some refinements to the html.
